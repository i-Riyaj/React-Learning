# Reconciliation

In easy terms, **reconciliation** in React is like a smart system that figures out what parts of a webpage need to change and updates only those parts. Imagine you have a puzzle on your table, and someone gives you a new piece. Instead of rearranging the whole puzzle, you just find where the new piece fits and put it there.

### Here's how reconciliation works in React:

- Virtual Representation: React keeps a virtual representation of your webpage's structure in memory. It's like a blueprint of how your webpage should look.

- Changes Detection: When something changes in your webpage, like user input or new data coming in, React checks the virtual representation against the actual webpage to see what's different.

- Smart Updates: React is smart about figuring out what parts of the webpage need to change. It doesn't repaint the whole webpage every time. Instead, it identifies the specific parts that need updating and only changes those parts.

- Efficient Rendering: By updating only the necessary parts, React makes rendering your webpage faster and more efficient. It saves resources and makes your webpage feel responsive to users.

In essence, reconciliation is like having a handy assistant who quickly scans your webpage for changes and efficiently updates only what's needed, without wasting time or effort. It's one of the reasons why React is so popular for building dynamic and fast web applications.

# React Fibre

React Fiber is an **internal reimplementation of the React core algorithm**, introduced in React version 16. It's not something developers directly interact with, but it significantly impacts how **React manages updates**, **handles asynchronous rendering**, and **maintains performance**.

### Here are key points about React Fiber:

- Reconciliation Algorithm: Fiber is primarily focused on the **reconciliation algorithm**, which is the process of determining what parts of the user interface need to be updated based on changes in state or props. **Fiber introduces a new, more efficient reconciliation algorithm that can be paused, aborted, or resumed**. This enables React to prioritize and manage updates more effectively, especially in complex user interfaces.

- Asynchronous Rendering: Fiber allows React to perform work **asynchronously**, meaning it can break down rendering work into smaller chunks and **prioritize high-priority updates while deferring lower-priority tasks**. As a result, React can maintain a smooth and responsive user interface, even when dealing with heavy computation or rendering tasks.

- Incremental Rendering: Fiber enables incremental rendering, which means React can update the UI gradually as it completes work on each chunk of the render tree. This incremental approach helps to improve perceived performance and responsiveness, especially in applications with large component trees or complex rendering logic.

- Better User Experience: By leveraging Fiber's capabilities, React can handle interactions, animations, and updates more efficiently, resulting in a smoother and more responsive user experience. Fiber's ability to pause and resume work also helps to prevent UI jank or stuttering, even under heavy load.

- Under the Hood Optimization: While Fiber doesn't change the public API of React, it represents a significant improvement in how React manages rendering and updates internally. It allows React to be more adaptable to different environments, prioritize rendering work more effectively, and handle complex component trees with greater efficiency.

In summary, React Fiber is an internal reimplementation of React's core algorithm that introduces features like asynchronous rendering, incremental updates, and improved performance optimizations. While developers may not interact directly with Fiber, it plays a crucial role in making React more efficient, responsive, and capable of handling modern web application requirements.
